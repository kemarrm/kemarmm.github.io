        <h2>Strongest Trait and Its Impact</h2>
        <p>One of my strongest traits is my Determination. This quality has a significant impact on my academic life. Once I set a goal, I pursue it with unwavering focus and perseverance. Whether I'm navigating a tough challenge or working steadily through my studies, I remain driven to see things through to completion. .</p>

        <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <p>My hero is My Uncle Kevin Williams. As a software engineer, my uncle has always been someone I admire. He inspires me to stay focused and work hard in school, just as he did when he was pursuing
            his own studies. Watching him navigate his career with dedication and a passion for technology has shown me the value of being organized and diligent
            His career has also shaped my own ambitions. Seeing him succeed as a software engineer has inspired me to follow a similar path and his guidance has been invaluable as I work toward building my own career in computer science.

    <section id="personality-test">
        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
        <p> I took the Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test to learn more about  my personality type. Below is a screenshot of the test results:</p>
        <img src="../assets/personality test result.png" alt="Personality Test Results">
        <p>* The results of the test show that I'm a Guardian. The Guardian personality, according to the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, is typically characterized by
            traits such as being dependable, hardworking, and protective of others. Guardians are practical,
            organized, and committed to ensuring stability and security.
            I find that this result represents my personality in a general sense but still not capturing certain aspects it is still what i would classify myself as .
            The description of Guardians as hardworking is a aspect I relate to, especially in my academic  where i have a strong work ethic and are very
            organized and manage my time well.</p>
